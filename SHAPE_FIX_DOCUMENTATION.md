# Shape Mismatch Fix Documentation

## Issue Fixed
The application was experiencing the following error:
```
"Input 0 of layer 'dense' is incompatible with the layer: expected axis -1 of input shape to have value 13, but received input with shape (1, 12)"
```

This error occurred because the TensorFlow model (`diabetes_model_final.h5`) was expecting 13 input features, but we were only providing 12. The missing feature was `smoking_history_No Info`.

## Files Modified

### 1. `app.py`
- Added the missing `smoking_history_No Info` feature to the `categorical_features` list
- Modified the `/predict` endpoint to:
  - Handle the missing feature with a default value of 0 if not provided in the JSON data
  - Added additional debug logging to check the shape of the feature array
  - Updated input validation to exclude the new feature from the required fields list

### 2. `static/js/script.js`
- Added `smoking_history_No Info` to the smoking history data object with a default value of 0
- Added a condition to set `smoking_history_No Info` to 1 when "No Information" is selected in the form

### 3. `templates/index.html`
- Added a new option "No Information" to the smoking history dropdown menu
- This option corresponds to the `smoking_history_No Info` feature expected by the model

## How the Fix Works

1. **Complete Feature Set**: The application now sends all 13 features expected by the model.
2. **Default Value Handling**: If the user doesn't select "No Information", the feature defaults to 0.
3. **Consistent Shape**: The input shape is now (1, 13) instead of (1, 12), matching what the model expects.
4. **Graceful Handling**: The app handles both new requests (with the "No Information" option) and older requests (without it) by adding default values.

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that the input data shape matches what the model expects. By examining the model's expected input shape (13 features), we identified the missing feature (`smoking_history_No Info`) and added it to our processing pipeline.

The fix maintains all other functionality like form validation, result display, and UI styling.

## Testing

To verify the fix works correctly:
1. Fill out the form including a selection for "Smoking History"
2. Submit the form
3. Check that no errors occur and a prediction is returned
4. Verify in the server logs that the features array has the shape (1, 13)

## Note on Backward Compatibility

- The app will still work with older requests that don't include the new feature, as it defaults to 0.
- The existing scaler only applies to numeric features and is not affected by this change.
